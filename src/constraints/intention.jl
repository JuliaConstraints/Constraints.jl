#!NOTE - constraints of type intension represent general predicate over a set of variables

# TODO - Add a DSL for intension (cf XCSP3-core)

const description_dist_different = """
A constraint ensuring that the distances between marks on the ruler are unique. Specifically, it checks that the distance between `x[1]` and `x[2]`, and the distance between `x[3]` and `x[4]`, are different. This constraint is fundamental in ensuring the validity of a Golomb ruler, where no two pairs of marks should have the same distance between them.

    xcsp_intension(list, predicate)

An intensional constraint is usually defined from a `predicate` over `list`. As such it encompass any generic constraint.

# Arguments
- `list::Vector{Int}`: A list of variables
- `predicate::Function`: A predicate over `list`

# Variants
- `:dist_different`: $description_dist_different
```julia
concept(:dist_different, x)
concept(:dist_different)(x)
```

# Examples
````julia
using Constraints # hide
c = concept(:dist_different)
c([1, 2, 3, 3]) && !c([1, 2, 3, 4])
````
